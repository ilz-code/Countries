------  
This project gets data about EU countries    
from https://restcountries.com/v2/regionalbloc/eu and returns 10 countries (in descending order) with    
biggest population, 10 countries with largest area and ten countries with the biggest density of population.

How to run project:    
1. Save files
2. In Command line (in projec directory) write: ./mvnw spring-boot:run   
-------
This is my first java project.   
There was quite a bit of time to complete the task.   
I will continue to supplement it:   
1. Improve results output, using REST API;     
2. Add .jar file; 
3. Add some more tests

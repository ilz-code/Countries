------  
This project gets data about EU countries    
from https://restcountries.com/v2/regionalbloc/eu and returns 10 countries (in descending order) with    
biggest population, 10 countries with largest area and ten countries with the biggest density of population.  
Project shows results in two ways simultaneously:   
In command line and at http://localhost:8080/population, http://localhost:8080/area and http://localhost:8080/density

How to run project:    
1. Save files
2. In Command line (in projec directory) write: ./mvnw spring-boot:run   
      (jdk-17 must be installed, and JAVA_HOME variable set)   
-------
This is my first java project.   
There was quite a bit of time to complete the task.   
Project can be improved:   
1. Improve results output;     
2. Add .jar file; 
3. Add some more tests

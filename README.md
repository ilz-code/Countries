This project gets data about EU countries    
from https://restcountries.com/v2/regionalbloc/eu
and returns 10 countries (in descending order) with    
biggest population, 10 countries with largest area   
and ten countries with biggest density of population.   
------
How to run project:    
1. Save files
2. In Command line (in directory where the project is)   
  write: ./mvnw spring-boot:run   
-------
There was quite a bit of time to complete the task.   
I will continue to supplement it:   
1. Improve results output;   
2. Add some more tests
